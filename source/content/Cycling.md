# League of Legends Champion Cycling Plan — Wave Control Focus

This document is a **structured champion cycling plan** for mastering wave control, tempo, and macro decision-making. It is based on the Broken by Concept concept of champion cycling, adapted to your champion pool.

## Champion Pool

| Champion        | Role / Notes                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Taliyah         | Mid, primary wave control teacher     |
| Orianna         | Mid, precision and neutral wave control |
| Aurora          | Mid, controlled pushing / spacing     |
| Galio           | Mid/Top, anti-poke / stabilization    |
| Twisted Fate    | Mid, global tempo / wave-dependent roams |
| Pantheon        | Mid/Top, flexible aggression / AD option |
| Orianna / Ahri  | Optional rotational / skill refinement |
| Naafiri         | Not included in wave control cycle    |
| Soraka (Mid)    | Not included, niche / cheese          |

## Champion Cycling Summary Table

| Phase | Primary Champion | Secondary / Rotational Champion | Goal / Purpose |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| 1 | Taliyah | Orianna | Fundamentals — deliberately place the wave and understand why it’s there |
| 2 | Taliyah | Aurora | Controlled Pressure — use wave advantage to create tempo without committing |
| 3 | Taliyah | Galio | Anti-Poke & Stability — minimize loss and preserve future options in difficult lanes |
| 4 | Taliyah | Twisted Fate | Global Tempo — act based on future wave states, planning roams efficiently |
| 5 | Taliyah / Orianna | Pantheon | Flexible Aggression — constrain the enemy with wave-based threat without unnecessary risk |

**Notes:**
- Primary champion (Taliyah) remains the anchor in most phases.
- Secondary champion rotates intentionally to expose you to different wave control perspectives.
- Galio and Pantheon are situational picks for anti-poke and flexible aggression, not constant rotation.

## Phase Explanations and In-Game Focus

### **Phase 1 — Fundamentals**
**Duo:** Taliyah + Orianna  
**Goal:** Deliberately place the wave and understand why it is there.  
**In-Game Thoughts:**
- “If I do nothing, where does this wave go?”
- “Am I holding, crashing, or giving?”
- “Can I complete a push safely, or should I wait?”
- Success: You understand every wave movement, lose CS on purpose, and leave lane with tempo intact.

---

### **Phase 2 — Controlled Pressure**
**Duo:** Taliyah + Aurora  
**Goal:** Use wave advantage to create tempo without committing to fights.  
**In-Game Thoughts:**
- “If I push this wave, what responses am I forcing?”
- “Am I creating opportunities or overextending?”
- “Does my movement or spell usage maintain wave control?”
- Success: Your pushes always lead to resets, wards, or safe roams; autopush is minimized.

---

### **Phase 3 — Anti-Poke & Stability**
**Duo:** Taliyah + Galio  
**Goal:** Minimize loss and preserve future options in difficult lanes.  
**In-Game Thoughts:**
- “Is this action making my situation better or worse in 1–2 waves?”
- “Can I survive poke without overcommitting?”
- “Do I need to swap to Galio this matchup for stability?”
- Success: You stay calm, reduce unnecessary trades, and maintain wave discipline even in losing lanes.

---

### **Phase 4 — Global Tempo**
**Duo:** Taliyah + Twisted Fate  
**Goal:** Act based on future wave states, not current ones; plan roams efficiently.  
**In-Game Thoughts:**
- “Where will the wave be when I return after a roam?”
- “Is this roam worth more than the CS or plates I leave behind?”
- “Am I leaving lane too early or too late?”
- Success: Roams feel calculated, not rushed; waves are rarely lost unnecessarily.

---

### **Phase 5 — Flexible Aggression**
**Duo:** Taliyah / Orianna + Pantheon  
**Goal:** Constrain the enemy using wave threat without overcommitting for kills.  
**In-Game Thoughts:**
- “What can the enemy not do because of my wave state?”
- “Am I creating pressure without risking unnecessary trades?”
- “Am I denying enemy roams effectively?”
- Success: Enemy mid loses options, pressure is applied through wave control, and risk of death is minimized.

## Universal Guiding Principle

> **“What happens to the wave if I do nothing?”**

Ask this for **every wave**, every spell, and every recall. Mastering this is the foundation of all five phases.

---

## Notes on Champion Selection

- Rotate secondary champions **intentionally**, never emotionally.  
- Primary rotation occurs only after mastery or plateau is reached (~15–20 games per phase).  
- Avoid using Naafiri and Soraka mid for wave control practice; they do not reinforce the learning goals.  
- Ahri can be reintroduced after mastering fundamentals for skill refinement and mobility practice.

## How to Use This Plan

1. Pick the **current phase** based on your learning goal.  
2. Select **primary + secondary champions** as defined.  
3. Focus on **in-game thoughts** specific to the phase.  
4. Rotate champions **after completing 3–5 games** or identifying a clear learning objective.  
5. Track **success metrics**:
   - Wave placement clarity  
   - HP/resource management  
   - Efficient roams / rotations  
   - Enemy pressure denial
