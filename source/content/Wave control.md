# Why Use Wave Control

## Flexible Aggression

Use wave state to create **threat pressure**:
- Force the enemy to stay in lane or lose farm/tempo.
- Avoid overcommitting for kills — let wave position and threat do the work.
- Maintain a safe distance while zoning with abilities and auto-attacks.
## Roaming / Global Tempo

Before leaving lane, check the wave state:

- **Freeze** if the enemy can punish a lost wave.
- **Slow push** if you want it to crash while you roam.
- Ensure the wave will be in a safe or advantageous state when you return.  
    Ask yourself:

> “What happens to the wave if I leave now?”

# How to Use Wave Control

## Death Wave State 

- Keep the wave in **tower range but not under it**.
- This lets you poke the enemy safely while farming.
- Be aware of enemy jungler pressure — don’t overextend.

## Slow Push / Build Pressure (Default, it helps preassure)

- When the enemy leaves lane or uses major cooldowns, **last-hit only some minions** to gradually build a bigger wave.
- Optional: poke or harass the enemy while doing it.
- **Goal:** crash the wave later under the enemy tower to force them to choose between taking poke or losing farm.
- Watch enemy return timing — avoid overstacking if you can’t reset safely.

## Freezing / Safety Control (Vs. Long-Range Poke)

- Keep the wave **near your tower** if the enemy has heavy poke or all-in threat.
- Only last-hit minions you can reach safely. Avoid unnecessary autos.
- **Goal:** minimize HP/mana loss while maintaining control.
- Call for jungle or support assistance if the enemy steps up.

## Fast Crash / Reset Wave (When You Want to Recall or Roam)

- Only use if the lane is completely safe (enemy mid gone, jungle nearby, cooldowns down).
- Clear the wave quickly to deal turret damage and open roam opportunities.
- Immediately reset vision or rotate — **wave crash is a tool to create map pressure**, not just farm.
