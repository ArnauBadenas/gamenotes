Synchronize wave state with bot or top lane depending on the objective so they crash at the same time so your team can do the objective safely.

1. Goal of lane
	1. Resources
	2. Wave
	3. Laning

## Resources
Focus on your resources, not on your enemy. HP, gold and experience are what wins the lane.
## Wave
Autoattack minions that is getting targeted by enemy creeps, not others, its ok to sit back and not hit them sometimes.
## Lane control
Focus on getting 1 or 2 good trades in the whole laning phase, no need to trade so much, and keep your hp high.
## Syncronize tempo with your team
Look at your teammate's location and try to predict when they will make a play.
- Wave crashes
- Full clear finished
Crash your wave when your team is ready to play.

When your team is not ready, we DONT need to push! Communicate what we want to the team so they can adapt to us too.
## Wave management
Hold a caster minion to guarantee a slow push. Leave it alive until next wave so the next wave has 1 more minion to their side and your wave goes to your tower.
